## 🚀 **How to Publish Your Neon Agent Extension to VS Code Marketplace**

I've created a complete publishing guide in PUBLISHING.md and set up your extension for marketplace publishing. Here's your step-by-step process:

### **📋 Pre-Publishing Setup (One-time)**

1. **Create Microsoft Account & Azure DevOps:**
   - Go to https://dev.azure.com/
   - Sign in with Microsoft account
   - Create an organization

2. **Create Publisher Profile:**
   - Visit https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage
   - Sign in and create publisher profile
   - Choose a unique publisher name (you currently have "neon-agent")

3. **Generate Personal Access Token:**
   - In Azure DevOps → User Settings → Personal Access Tokens
   - Create token with "Marketplace: Manage" scope
   - Save the token securely

4. **Login to VSCE:**
   ```bash
   vsce login your-publisher-name
   ```
   Enter your Personal Access Token when prompted.

### **🛠️ Required Actions Before Publishing**

1. **Create Extension Icon:**
   - Create a 128x128px PNG icon
   - Save as `c:\Users\ELITEBOOK 840 G3\Neon-Agent\images\icon.png`
   - This is REQUIRED for marketplace publishing

2. **Update Publisher Name:**
   - If you want a different publisher name, update package.json:
   ```json
   "publisher": "your-chosen-publisher-name"
   ```

3. **Final Verification:**
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\ELITEBOOK 840 G3\Neon-Agent"
   npm run compile
   npm run lint
   npm run package
   ```

### **🚀 Publishing Commands**

Once setup is complete:

```bash
# Test package creation
npm run package

# Publish to marketplace
npm run publish

# Or publish with version updates
npm run publish-patch   # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1  
npm run publish-minor   # 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
npm run publish-major   # 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
```

### **✅ Current Status**

Your extension is **99% ready** for publishing! You have:
- ✅ Complete TypeScript extension with all AI features
- ✅ Proper package.json with marketplace fields
- ✅ Publishing scripts configured
- ✅ VSCE installed and working
- ✅ Documentation and licensing

**Missing only:**
- 🔲 Extension icon (128x128px PNG)
- 🔲 Publisher account setup
- 🔲 Personal Access Token

### **📈 After Publishing**

Once published, your extension will be available at:
`https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=your-publisher.neon-agent`

Users can install it with:
```bash
code --install-extension your-publisher.neon-agent
```

### **🎯 Next Steps**

1. **Create the icon** (`images/icon.png` - 128x128px)
2. **Set up marketplace accounts** (Microsoft/Azure DevOps)
3. **Run** `npm run package` to test
4. **Run** `npm run publish` to go live!
